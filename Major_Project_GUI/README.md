#  _Document Filtering Using Evolution Keyword Patterns_

## _Project Description_

This project is created with an aim to provide the users an extra layer to filter out the documents from an archive of documents. This project adds up an option to filter the documents based on the keywords that holds up certain importance to the respective documents. That way searching can be done faster and easier.

## _Approach_
The approach used in this project can be divided into several steps :-
- Pre-Processing
	> This phase includes all the pre-processing like removal of stopwods, lemmatize, removal of punctuation etc.
- Model creation
	> This phase creates appropriate machine learning model that is used to extract important keywords.
- Model Training
	> This phase includes training of the model using suitable dataset.
- Extracting Keywords
	> After training is complete, 5 keywords are extracted from each document which will then be used in UI.
- Representing them in User Interface
	> Final phase of this project includes the creation of User-Interface to build a prototype.
